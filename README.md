# CS411A2-4-Group-Project
[WIP] Project description about the project that this group is working on

The project should take an aggregation of the user’s social media posts and retain frequency of words that he or she has used. Then, using the gathered data, this project should be able to create a word cloud generated by the user’s posts and then create either a post, a paragraph, or a letter generated from the data provided by the user.
